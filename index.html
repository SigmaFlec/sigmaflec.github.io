                <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
                My name is Patrick. I'm on a computer all the time.<br>
                I grew up with the internet and games like Warcraft 2, Unreal Tournament and Heroes of Might and Magic 3.<br>
                I can still remember the dial-up connection noises, as well as my mom or dad wanting to use the phone and getting an earful of computer noise.<br>
                I've always enjoyed learning how computers work and I am used to being the one to help my mom with basic computer tasks like transferring files ("You know how to drag and drop...") 
                or how to get a picture printed off, etc. so between my brother and I, we were the computer wizards.<br>
